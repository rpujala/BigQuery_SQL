# BigQuery_SQL
Hi, I am Rajiv Pujala, I work as a Data Scientist cum Program Manager at Google. I have overall 12+ years of experience in the Supply Chain Data Science domain.

Through this channel, I committed myself to share about BigQuery SQL end to end, covering basics to top notch advanced level concepts which helps anyone to write their own scripts.

One thing I would follow and also share with my students: Learning never goes waste. When we start learning new tools and technologies, we adapt to new ideas and grow in the workplace.

We are in the era of Gemini and ChatGpt, but without knowing basics of anything, its not intuitive to understand how these languages work and how to custom.

Write your own scripts and then use Gemini or ChatGPT on how to optimize the queries.
